The aim is to fulfil the needs of European and national policy development and the requirements of both commercial and public downstream services, e.g. for planning, monitoring, efficiency improvements and the integration of solar energy systems into energy supply grids.\nFor clear-sky conditions, an irradiation time series is provided for any location in the world using information on aerosol, ozone and water vapour from the CAMS global forecasting system. Other properties, such as ground albedo and ground elevation, are also taken into account. Similar time series are available for cloudy (or \"all sky\") conditions but, since the high-resolution cloud information is directly inferred from satellite observations, these are currently only available inside the field-of-view of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, which is roughly Europe, Africa, the Atlantic Ocean and the Middle East.\nData is offered in both ASCII and netCDF format. Additionally, an ASCII \"expert mode\" format can be selected which contains in addition to the irradiation, all the input data used in their calculation (aerosol optical properties, water vapour concentration, etc). This additional information is only meaningful in the time frame at which the calculation is performed and so is only available at 1-minute time steps in universal time (UT).","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2004-02-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES","keywords":["airPollution","Radiation","Satellite image area","Global","Past","Analysis","Solar radiation","Atmospheric conditions"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES/order","method":"POST","rel":"retrieve","title":"Retrieve","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES/queryables","rel":"http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/queryables","title":"Queryables","type":"application/schema+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES/items","rel":"items","title":"Items","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_SOLAR_RADIATION_TIMESERIES","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-solar-radiation-timeseries?tab=overview","rel":"cite-as","title":"CAMS solar radiation time-series","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/jOLjDw","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS solar radiation time-series: data documentation","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/supplementary-services#fa6856b7-a306-4cc4-9137-f3e0cb703093","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation and quality assurance (EQA) reports","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1127/metz/2022/1132","rel":"cite-as","title":"Surface solar irradiation retrieval from MSG/SEVIRI based on APOLLO Next Generation and HELIOSAT‑4 methods","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1127/metz/2016/0781","rel":"cite-as","title":"Fast radiative transfer parameterisation for assessing the surface solar irradiance: The Heliosat‑4 method","type":"text/html"}],"providers":[{"name":"ECMWF","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"}],"published":"2023-12-12T15:24:18Z","sci:citation":"CAMS solar radiation time-series.

Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 280 ppm by human activities, primarily because of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and other land-use change. The annual cycle (especially in the northern hemisphere) is primarily due to seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial vegetation.\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged carbon dioxide abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the carbon dioxide concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, carbon dioxide abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite \ninstruments. Typically, different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore, which product to use for a given application typically depends on the application.\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CO2, denoted XCO2 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CO2 columns.  The XCO2 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and OCO-2. The mid-tropospheric CO2 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments on-board the Metop satellite series and from AIRS. \nThe XCO2 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: BESD and WFMD algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP and SRFP algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCO2 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. \nThe IASI and AIRS products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY and AIRS L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nVariables in the dataset/application are:\nColumn-average dry-air mole fraction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2), Mid-tropospheric columns of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2002-10-01T00:00:00Z","2022-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","keywords":["Atmosphere (composition)","Satellite observations","Global","Past","Atmospheric conditions"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT/order","method":"POST","rel":"retrieve","title":"Retrieve","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT/queryables","rel":"http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/queryables","title":"Queryables","type":"application/schema+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT/items","rel":"items","title":"Items","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CO2_DATA_FROM_SATELLITE_SENSORS_2002_PRESENT","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/ghg-cci/ghg-cci_0911d58e24365e15589377902e562c6e9231290f75b14ddc3c7cb5fd09a265af.pdf","rel":"license","title":"GHG-CCI Licence","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.f74805c8","rel":"cite-as","title":"Carbon dioxide data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations","type":"text/html"}],"providers":[{"name":"ECMWF","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"}],"published":"2023-08-28T15:11:18Z","sci:citation":"Copernicus Climate Change Service, Climate Data Store, (2018): \"Carbon dioxide data from 2002 to present derived from satellite observations\".

The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 10 days with one satellite and 5 days with 2 satellites, making the data of great use in on-going studies. The satellites are equipped with the state-of-the-art MSI (Multispectral Imager) instrument, that offers high-resolution optical imagery. Products are a compilation of elementary granules of fixed size, within a single orbit. A granule is the minimum indivisible partition of a product (containing all possible spectral bands).\nFor Level-1C and Level-2A, the granules, also called tiles, are 100x100km2 ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection. The UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) system divides the Earth's surface into 60 zones. Each UTM zone has a vertical width of 6° of longitude and horizontal width of 8° of latitude. (see Figure 1). Tiles are approximately 600 MB in size. Tiles can be fully or partially covered by image data. Partially covered tiles correspond to those at the edge of the swath. Level-2A: Surface reflectances in cartographic geometry. This product is considered as the mission Analysis Ready Data (ARD), the product that can be used directly in downstream applications without the need for further processing. The Level-2A product contains: Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance orthoimage, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, Water Vapour (WV) map, Scene Classification map and Quality Indicators data.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2015-07-04T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ESA.DAT.SENTINEL-2.MSI.L2A","item_assets":{"thumbnail":{"description":"An averaged, decimated preview image in PNG format.

The ESA SST CCI and C3S level 4 analyses were produced by running the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system (Good et al., 2020) to provide a high resolution (1/20deg. - approx. 5km grid resolution) daily analysis of the daily average sea surface temperature (SST) at 20 cm depth for the global ocean. Only (A)ATSR, SLSTR and AVHRR satellite data processed by the ESA SST CCI and C3S projects were used, giving a stable product.
