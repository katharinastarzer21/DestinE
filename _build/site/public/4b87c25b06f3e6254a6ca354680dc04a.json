The production is based on an ensemble of eleven air quality forecasting systems across Europe. A median ensemble is calculated from individual outputs, since ensemble products yield on average better performance than the individual model products. The spread between the eleven models are used to provide an estimate of the forecast uncertainty. The analysis combines model data with observations provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA) into a complete and consistent dataset using various data assimilation techniques depending upon the air-quality forecasting system used. In parallel, air quality forecasts are produced once a day for the next four days. Both the analysis and the forecast are available at hourly time steps at seven height levels.\nNote that only nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, PM2.5, PM10 and dust are regularly validated against in situ observations, and therefore forecasts of all other variables are unvalidated and should be considered experimental.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-25,30,45,72]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2020-08-26T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_EUROPE_AIR_QUALITY_FORECASTS","keywords":["Aerosol","airPollution","Europe","Future","Present","Analysis","Atmospheric conditions","Past","Reactive gas","Atmosphere (composition)","Forecast"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_EUROPE_AIR_QUALITY_FORECASTS/order","method":"POST","rel":"retrieve","title":"Retrieve","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_EUROPE_AIR_QUALITY_FORECASTS/queryables","rel":"http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/queryables","title":"Queryables","type":"application/schema+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_EUROPE_AIR_QUALITY_FORECASTS/items","rel":"items","title":"Items","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_EUROPE_AIR_QUALITY_FORECASTS","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_EUROPE_AIR_QUALITY_FORECASTS","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/CAMS+Regional%3A+European+air+quality+analysis+and+forecast+data+documentation","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS Regional Products Documentation","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/regional-services","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation and quality assurance (EQA) reports","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-2777-2015","rel":"cite-as","title":"A regional air quality forecasting system over Europe: the MACC-II daily ensemble production","type":"text/html"}],"providers":[{"name":"ECMWF","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"}],"published":"2023-12-12T15:24:18Z","sci:citation":"Marécal, V., Peuch, V.-H., Andersson, C., Andersson, S., Arteta, J., Beekmann, M., Benedictow, A., Bergström, R., Bessagnet, B., Cansado, A., Chéroux, F., Colette, A., Coman, A., Curier, R.

The forecasts consist of more than 50 chemical species (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide) and seven different types of aerosol (desert dust, sea salt, organic matter, black carbon, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium aerosol). In addition, several meteorological variables are available as well.\nThe initial conditions of each forecast are obtained by combining a previous forecast with current satellite observations through a process called data assimilation. This best estimate of the state of the atmosphere at the initial forecast time step, called the analysis, provides a globally complete and consistent dataset allowing for estimates at locations where observation data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available.\nThe forecast itself uses a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry to determine the evolution of the concentrations of all species over time for the next five days. Apart from the required initial state, it also uses inventory-based or observation-based emission estimates as a boundary condition at the surface.\nThe CAMS global forecasting system is upgraded about once a year resulting in technical and scientific changes. The horizontal or vertical resolution can change, new species can be added, and more generally the accuracy of the forecasts can be improved. Details of these system changes can be found in the documentation. Users looking for a more consistent long-term data set should consider using the CAMS Global Reanalysis instead, which is available through the ADS and spans the period from 2003 onwards.\n Finally, because some meteorological fields in the forecast do not fall within the general CAMS data licence, they are only available with a delay of 5 days.","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2015-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST","keywords":["Aerosol","airPollution","Future","Present","Analysis","Forecast","Atmospheric conditions","Past","Reactive gas","Atmosphere (composition)","Atmosphere (meteorology)","Global"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST/order","method":"POST","rel":"retrieve","title":"Retrieve","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST/queryables","rel":"http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/queryables","title":"Queryables","type":"application/schema+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST/items","rel":"items","title":"Items","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_ATMOSHERIC_COMPO_FORECAST","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/5cqpD","rel":"describedby","title":"CAMS Global atmospheric composition forecast data documentation","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/node/326","rel":"describedby","title":"Changes in CAMS global production system","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/node/325#fd66a9d3-e408-4b51-84c0-c2253a06f727","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation and quality assurance (EQA) reports","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://global-evaluation.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/","rel":"describedby","title":"Evaluation of global forecasts","type":"text/html"}],"providers":[{"name":"ECMWF","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"}],"published":"2023-12-12T15:24:18Z","stac_extensions":["https://stac-extensions.github.io/timestamps/v1.1.0/schema.json"],"stac_version":"1.0.0","summaries":{"federation:backends":["cop_ads","wekeo_ecmwf"]},"title":"CAMS global atmospheric composition forecasts","type":"Collection","updated":"2025-06-12T09:22:22Z"},{"assets":{"thumbnail":{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/resources/cams-global-fire-emissions-gfas/overview_eaf1132e6ada572e7ab38d00431929a48be55ac21bb5ec24bbe5d0c65be670ad.png","roles":["thumbnail"],"title":"overview","type":"image/png"}},"created":"2024-05-31T09:50:00Z","dedl:short_description":"This dataset provides geographical distributions of the radiative forcing (RF) by key atmospheric constituents.","description":"Emissions of atmospheric pollutants from biomass burning and vegetation fires are key drivers of the evolution of atmospheric composition, with a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, and an accurate representation of them in models is essential.\n\nThe CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) utilises satellite observations of fire radiative power (FRP) to provide near-real-time information on the location, relative intensity and estimated emissions from biomass burning and vegetation fires. Emissions are estimated by (i) conversion of FRP observations to the dry matter (DM) consumed by the fire, and (ii) application of emission factors to DM for different biomes, based on field and laboratory studies in the scientific literature, to estimate the emissions. Emissions estimates for 40 pyrogenic species are available from GFAS, including aerosols, reactive gases and greenhouse gases, on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees longitude by 0.1 degrees latitude.\n\nThis version of GFAS (v1.2) provides daily averaged data based on a combination of FRP observations from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, one on the NASA EOS-Terra satellite and the other on the NASA EOS-Aqua satellite from 1 January 2003 to present. GFAS also provides daily estimates of smoke plume injection heights derived from FRP observations and meteorological information from the operational weather forecasts from ECMWF.\n\nGFAS data have been used to provide surface boundary conditions for the CAMS global atmospheric composition and European regional air quality forecasts, and the wider atmospheric chemistry modelling community.\n\nMore details about the products are given in the Documentation section.\n\n## How to cite the CAMS GFAS data\n\nPlease acknowledge the use of the CAMS GFAS data as stated in the [Copernicus CAMS License agreement](http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/copernicus/):\n\tWhere the Licensee communicates to the public or distributes or publishes CAMS Information, the Licensee shall inform the recipients of the source of that information by using the following or any similar notice:\n'Generated using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Information [Year]'.\n\tWhere the Licensee makes or contributes to a publication or distribution containing adapted or modified CAMS Information, the Licensee shall provide the following or any similar notice:\n'Contains modified Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Information [Year]';\n\nAny such publication or distribution shall state that \"neither the European Commission nor ECMWF is responsible for any use that may be made of the information it contains.\"","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2003-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS","keywords":["Aerosol","airPollution","Present","Analysis","Atmospheric conditions","Emissions and surface fluxes","Reactive gas","Past","Global"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS/order","method":"POST","rel":"retrieve","title":"Retrieve","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS/queryables","rel":"http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/queryables","title":"Queryables","type":"application/schema+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS/items","rel":"items","title":"Items","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.CAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/to1CBQ","rel":"describedby","title":"Documentation on the CAMS global fire assimilation system","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16906-improving-gfas-and-cams-biomass-burning-estimations-means-global-ecmwf-fire-forecast-system.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Improving CAMS biomass burning estimations by means of the Global ECMWFFire Forecast system (GEFF)","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2013/7707-assessment-global-fire-assimilation-system-gfasv1.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Assessment of the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1)","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2010/9842-assessment-real-time-fire-emissions-gfasv0-macc.pdf","rel":"describedby","title":"Assessment of the Real-Time Fire Emissions (GFASv0) by MACC","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2017-790","rel":"cite-as","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-2921-2017","rel":"cite-as","type":"text/html"}],"providers":[{"name":"ECMWF","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"}],"published":"2024-05-31T09:50:00Z","sci:publications":[{"citation":"Kaiser, J.
