It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2). The geopotential height plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns). Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.","dimensions":["x","y","z","time"],"shortNameECMWF":"z","type":"data","units":"m^2 s^-2"},"ozone_mass_mixing_ratio":{"description":"This parameter is the mass of ozone per kilogram of air. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms. Most of the IFS chemical species are archived as mass mixing ratios [kg kg-1].","dimensions":["x","y","z","time"],"shortNameECMWF":"o3","type":"data","units":"kg kg^-1"},"potential_vorticity":{"description":"Potential vorticity is a measure of the capacity for air to rotate in the atmosphere. If we ignore the effects of heating and friction, potential vorticity is conserved following an air parcel. It is used to look for places where large wind storms are likely to originate and develop. Potential vorticity increases strongly above the tropopause and therefore, it can also be used in studies related to the stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere exchanges. Large wind storms develop when a column of air in the atmosphere starts to rotate. Potential vorticity is calculated from the wind, temperature and pressure across a column of air in the atmosphere.","dimensions":["x","y","z","time"],"shortNameECMWF":"pv","type":"data","units":"K m^2 kg^-1 s^-1"},"relative_humidity":{"description":"This parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice). For temperatures over 0°C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water. At temperatures below -23°C it is calculated for saturation over ice.

The quantity is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles.

Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread. ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified. The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.\nIt should satisfy the requirements for most common applications. An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article .\nInformation on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines . Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for\nthe uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).\nThere are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).

ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. ERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'. The ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields. The temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period covered in time, as well as the fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers, businesses and individuals to access and use more accurate information on land states.\n\nMain Variables:[['Name'\t'Full_Name'\t'ShortName'\t'Units'\t'Description'\t'url']\n ['10m u-component of wind'\t'10m U wind over land'\t'~'\t'm.s⁻¹'\n  'Eastward component of the 10m wind.

This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has only been the case for the month September 2021, while it will also be the case for October, November and December 2021. For months prior to September 2021 the final release has always been equal to ERA5T, and the goal is to align the two again after December 2021.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).","extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1940-01-01T00:00:00Z",null]]}},"id":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS","keywords":["Atmospheric conditions","Past","Atmosphere (upper air)","Copernicus C3S","Global","Atmosphere (surface)","Reanalysis"],"license":"proprietary","links":[{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS/order","method":"POST","rel":"retrieve","title":"Retrieve","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS/queryables","rel":"http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/queryables","title":"Queryables","type":"application/schema+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS/items","rel":"items","title":"Items","type":"application/geo+json"},{"href":"https://hda.data.destination-earth.eu/stac/v2/collections/EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS","rel":"self","title":"EO.ECMWF.DAT.ERA5_MONTHLY_MEANS_VARIABLES_ON_PRESSURE_LEVELS","type":"application/json"},{"href":"https://object-store.os-api.cci2.ecmwf.int/cci2-prod-catalogue/licences/licence-to-use-copernicus-products/licence-to-use-copernicus-products_b4b9451f54cffa16ecef5c912c9cebd6979925a956e3fa677976e0cf198c2c18.pdf","rel":"license","title":"Licence to Use Copernicus Products","type":"application/pdf"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.6860a573","rel":"cite-as","title":"ERA5 monthly averaged data on pressure levels from 1940 to present","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3803","rel":"cite-as","title":"The ERA5 global reanalysis","type":"text/html"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.4174","rel":"cite-as","title":"The ERA5 global reanalysis: Preliminary extension to 1950","type":"text/html"}],"providers":[{"name":"ECMWF","roles":["licensor","producer","processor"],"url":"https://www.ecmwf.int/"}],"published":"2023-08-28T15:11:18Z","sci:citation":"Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Biavati, G., Horányi, A., Muñoz Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Rozum, I., Schepers, D., Simmons, A., Soci, C., Dee, D., Thépaut, J-N.
